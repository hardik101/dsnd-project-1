## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

However, You can also look into 'requirements.txt' file if you are missing specific package in your local enviroment.
I have used Python version 3.7.7 in my local machine 

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I have used airbnb datasets for [Berlin](https://www.kaggle.com/brittabettendorf/berlin-airbnb-data) 

I have tried to answer following questions through analysis of above dataset:

1. How prices for all Berlin's Airbnb fluctuate throughout the year 2019? 
2. What are the peak/off-peak times for Airbnb rental prices in Berlin?
3. Who are the hosts with the most number of Airbnb listings?
4. Which neighborhoods have the most number of listing in Berlin?
5. Which are the most expensive neighborhoods in Berlin?
6. Which are the popular neighborhoods based on the avg number of reviews
7. Which type of room has the majority of listings in Berlin Airbnb?
8. What are the features that influence the price in Berlin Airbnb? Can we predict the rental price of new listings based on a predictive model?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  
1. Notebook 1 provides basic understanding of the data 
2. Notebook 2 provides the walkthough for finding the answers pertaining to the questions listed above. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Kaggle and Airbnb for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/brittabettendorf/berlin-airbnb-data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
