## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

I have used Python version 3.7.7 in my local machine 

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I have used airbnb datasets for [Berlin](https://www.kaggle.com/brittabettendorf/berlin-airbnb-data) 

I have tried to answer following questions through analysis of above dataset:

1. The average price a single person has to pay for Berlin's Airbnb apartment?
2. Which neighbourhoods have the most number of listing in Berlin?
3. What is the distribution of Apartment accommodation size in Berlin?
4. Which type of properties (private rooms, entire apartments etc.) has the majority of listings in Berlin Airbnb?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a notebook under 'notebooks' folder to showcase work related to the above questions.  
Additonally, berlin_airbnb_analysis.html page provide the HTML version of notebook for better viewing of the code.
The corrresponding datasets/csv files can be found under 'data/berlin' folder.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available[here](https://medium.com/@hardikbalar101/a-closer-look-at-airbnb-listing-prices-and-why-you-should-care-4a8e4474aead).
